# python_schwarzchild_black_hole
This is a Python program generating a 2D render of a Schwarzchild Black Hole according to General Relativity, the code is slow and will take an increasing amount of time for increased resolution. Currently a work in progress with a simple accretion disk modelled as a solid with an radially exponential luminosity profile.
